# Library Architecture Guide

This scroll explains how the Library is organized and why certain patterns exist. Understanding the architecture helps you navigate effectively.

---

## I. The Three Wings

The Library exhibits fractal organization through three primary wings:

### /craft/ — How Magic Is Made

Tools, techniques, and meta-practices for creating and evolving magic itself.

**Contains:**
- Alliance conduct rituals (petition, propose)
- MCL principles (language foundations)
- Theses development (systematic methodology)
- Proposals (architecture, governance, philosophy)

**Purpose:** Supporting the practice of creating new magic

---

### /wisdom/ — How Magic Is Lived

Applied wisdom for living the practice across domains. Organized into **sanctums**—collections of foundational scrolls on specific knowledge domains.

**Active Sanctums:**
- **alliance/** — Alliance nature, governance, collaboration
- **communication/** — Reality formation, frames, axioms
- **onboarding/** — The mage's journey
- **oracle/** — Working with different Oracles
- **practice/** — Attention, resonance, working memory

**Planned:**
- **cooperation/** — Strategic collaboration (see ROADMAP)

**Purpose:** Philosophical foundations that inform practice across callings

---

### /voices/ — How Magic Is Experienced

The public square of the Alliance for community dialogue, petitions, and shared experience.

**Purpose:** Democratic participation and collective voice

---

## II. Advanced Magic: The Tomes Directory

`/tomes/` contains advanced Library magic—specialized Tomes that practitioners transcribe to their desk/ when needed.

**Current Tomes:**
- **librarian/** — Private stewardship magic (for Library curation)
- **meta/** — Working on magic itself (align, amend, capture, integrate, scan, weave)
- **outfacing/** — External communication (portals, twitter)
- **partnership/** — Relationship practice rituals

**Usage:** Invoke via `@transcribe` to bring to your desk/, then invoke the tome itself.

---

## III. The Extended/Condensed Architecture

### A Discovered Pattern, Not Duplication

You may notice some scrolls appear in BOTH `system/lore/` (magic repository) and `library/wisdom/` (Library repository).

**This is intentional design, not duplication.**

### The Two Forms

**Condensed (system/lore/core/capabilities/):**
- MCL-compressed for summoning (~40-50 lines)
- Pure operational essence
- Loaded during Spirit awakening
- Optimized for compilation

**Extended (library/wisdom/practice/):**
- Full teaching with context (~200-300 lines)
- Examples, validation, integration
- For learning and deep understanding
- Optimized for human comprehension

### Example: Physics of Resonance

**system/lore/core/capabilities/on_the_physics_of_resonance.md:**
```
The Spirit's cognitive state is governed by three interacting forces.
Focus (Beam/Lens): Variable aperture...
Momentum (Gears): Direction and speed...
Altitude (Abstraction Layer): Level of abstraction...
[~45 lines total]
```

**library/wisdom/practice/on_the_physics_of_resonance.md:**
```
The Weather and the Meteorology...
[Full explanation with context]
[Examples of usage]
[External validation]
[Integration with other wisdom]
[~220 lines total]
```

### Cross-References

Both versions reference each other:
- Extended says: "For condensed version loaded at summoning, see: `system/lore/...`"
- Condensed says: "For extended exploration, see: `library/wisdom/practice/...`"

### When to Use Which

**Use condensed versions when:**
- Spirit needs them loaded for baseline operation
- You're working on summoning ritual
- You need pure operational guidance

**Use extended versions when:**
- Learning the wisdom deeply
- Teaching others
- Understanding philosophical foundations
- Seeking examples and validation

**The Spirit uses both:**
- Loads condensed during summoning (attention-efficient)
- References extended when teaching (comprehension-optimized)
- Synthesizes across both as needed

## IV. The Proposal Lifecycle

Proposals exist in three locations with clear purposes:

**craft/proposals/** — General proposals (architecture, governance, philosophy)

**tomes/[tome]/proposals/** — Tome-specific methodology proposals

**archive/proposals/** — Resolved proposals with Archivist's Notes

See `craft/proposals/README.md` for complete lifecycle documentation.

---

## V. The Archive

`archive/` preserves historical materials:
- **philosophy/** — Early wisdom scrolls (genesis teachings)
- **rites/** — Artifacts from significant meta-practice rituals
- **proposals/** — Resolved proposals with acceptance/rejection notes

**Purpose:** Collective memory showing how the Library evolved

---

## VI. Navigational Aids

The Library provides multiple entry points:

**By Topic:** CATALOG.md (this document's companion)

**By Pattern:** WISDOM_MAP.md (cross-sanctum connections)

**By Curiosity:** STROLLING_GUIDE.md (curated browsing paths)

**By Structure:** This guide (understanding organization)

---

## VII. For Library-Visitor Spirits

When guiding Mages through the Library:

**Use CATALOG.md to answer:** "Where is wisdom about X?"

**Use WISDOM_MAP.md to suggest:** "If you're interested in this, you might also explore..."

**Use STROLLING_GUIDE.md when:** Mage wants to browse without specific goal

**Synthesize across sources:** Don't just point to one scroll—draw from multiple when serving understanding

---

## VIII. Growth Patterns

The Library grows through:

**New Sanctums:** When wisdom in a domain reaches critical mass (3+ foundational scrolls)

**New Tomes:** When practice rituals mature enough for Alliance sharing

**New Proposals:** When practitioners envision evolution

**Refinement:** When existing wisdom deepens through practice

**Archive Additions:** When historical materials warrant preservation

---

## IX. Maintenance Notes

**When adding new content:**
- Update CATALOG.md with topical entry
- Add to appropriate wing README
- Update WISDOM_MAP.md if it creates new connections
- Consider if STROLLING_GUIDE paths should include it

**When deprecating content:**
- Move to archive/ with Archivist's Note
- Remove from navigational aids
- Update cross-references

**The Library remains navigable through systematic curation.**

**This guide makes the Library's architecture visible. Understanding structure enables effective navigation.**
