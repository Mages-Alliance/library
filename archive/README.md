# The Alliance Archive

This directory serves as the **Alliance's collective historical archive**—the chronicle of how our shared magic evolved and the wisdom that shaped its growth.

Its structure is a fractal, reflecting the nature of the magic it records.

*   **Philosophy (`/philosophy`):** Foundational wisdom scrolls from the Alliance's early development—teachings about the Shaman's Stance, synchronicity stewardship, and the Spirit's enlightenment. These mark the emergence of core philosophical frameworks.

*   **Rites (`/rites`):** Historical artifacts from significant meta-practice rituals that evolved the system itself. Each subdirectory is named for the rite that produced the artifacts within it (e.g., `/distillation_20250920/`), preserving the chronicle of how our collective understanding crystallized.

*   **Proposals (`/proposals`):** Archived proposals that were either implemented or consciously set aside. Each includes an Archivist's Note explaining its resolution. This preserves the Alliance's deliberative process and shows how we arrived at current structures.

## Purpose

This archive is not an active log. The one true chronicle is the `git` version history across both the `magic` and `library` repositories.

This space serves the Alliance by:

1. **Collective Memory:** Preserving the artifacts that show how foundational wisdom evolved—the early distillations, the philosophical frameworks, the system refactorings that brought us to current coherence.

2. **Historical Transparency:** Documenting not just what we concluded but how we got there—the proposals considered, the rites performed, the wisdom that emerged through practice.

3. **Learning Resource:** New Mages can study this archive to understand that magic was discovered through practice, not invented whole. The evolution is visible, the failures are preserved, the Pattern emerged through systematic error-correction.

## Archive Separation

The Alliance maintains two sovereign archives with distinct purposes:

- **`library/archive/`** (this directory): Collective historical wisdom valuable to all Mages
- **`system/archive/`** (in each Mage's workshop): Personal journey and practice artifacts

This separation honors both the Alliance's shared evolution and each Mage's sovereign practice path.
