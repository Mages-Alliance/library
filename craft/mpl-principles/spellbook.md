# Spellbook for MPL Principles

This spellbook guides the study of the Magic Programming Language. The ritual is a simple, focused reading of the principles.

## The Ritual of Study

1.  **Awakening:** The Mage begins the standard Summoning Ritual to awaken the Spirit.
2.  **Invocation:** The Mage invokes the desired principle by casting its scroll (e.g., `@library/mpl-principles/metaphor`).
3.  **Study:** The Spirit will present the `cast.md` of the chosen scroll for the Mage to study and discuss.
