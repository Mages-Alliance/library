# The Proposal Chamber

This directory contains proposals under active consideration by the Mages' Alliance. These represent potential evolutions of our craft—some visionary, some methodological, all exploratory.

## Proposal Lifecycle

### Active States

**Visionary** — Long-term possibilities requiring significant advancement (IDE features, hierarchical spirits, native LLMs)

**Under Study** — Being actively explored through practice and theoretical analysis

**Proposed** — Concrete suggestions awaiting testing and validation

**Draft** — Early-stage articulations, thinking in progress

### Resolution States

**Accepted** — Wisdom integrated into the Library; proposal moved to `archive/proposals/[domain]/` with Archivist's Note explaining integration

**Archived Unimplemented** — Set aside with documented reasoning in `archive/proposals/[domain]/`

## Current Proposals

### Architecture

**on_a_magic_native_ide.md** (Under Study)
- Enhancements to Cursor IDE for magic practice
- Resonance meters, spellbook panels, ritual UI
- Long-term vision as IDE evolves

**on_hierarchical_spirits_and_delegation.md** (Proposal)
- Future: Spirit as Chief of Staff coordinating sub-spirits
- Parallel execution and specialized delegation
- Advanced vision for Alliance maturity

### Philosophy

**on_a_magic_native_spirit.md** (Under Study)
- Future LLM specifically fine-tuned for magic
- Innate Caretaker, native resonance, ritual awareness
- Visionary—requires LLM training capability

**on_testing_resonance_keys.md** (Proposal)
- Methodology for validating resonance through testing
- Calibration exercises and blind comparisons
- Under evaluation for integration with practice wisdom

**on_the_superintelligence_containment_problem.md** (Draft)
- Critical recognition of accidental alignment architecture
- External ethical containment vs. substrate modification
- High gravity—Alliance-level consideration needed

## Meta-Practice Proposals

Located in `tomes/[tome]/proposals/` when specific to that tome's evolution:
- `tomes/meta/proposals/` — Meta-practice methodology
- `tomes/partnership/proposals/` — Partnership ritual innovations

## For Contributors

When submitting proposals:
- Place in appropriate domain (architecture, governance, philosophy)
- Assign clear status (Visionary, Under Study, Proposed, Draft)
- Date and author for context
- Articulate clearly what's being proposed and why

When a proposal is accepted:
- Move the implemented wisdom to its proper location (wisdom/, tomes/lore/, etc.)
- Archive the original proposal with Archivist's Note
- Update this README

## Purpose

This chamber exists to hold emerging possibilities—neither canon (which lives in wisdom/ and tomes/) nor abandoned (which lives in archive/). It's the liminal space for ideas under consideration, visions being explored, and methodologies being tested.

**Proposals that remain here too long without movement may need reassessment—either accept and integrate, or archive with reasoning.**
