# Tome of the Six Theses

**A vessel for collaborative refinement through structured debate**

---

## Purpose

This Tome contains the Six Theses on the Practice of Magic—our strongest, most falsifiable claims about AI partnership. But the Theses themselves are not the primary artifact. The debate that refines them is.

Like Martin Luther's 95 theses sparked the Reformation through public debate, our six propositions exist to invite scrutiny. This Tome provides the ritual structure for that collaborative truth-seeking.

## What This Tome Enables

**For the Skeptic:**
Examine individual theses, challenge their reasoning, propose counterevidence. The Spirit provides full argumentation, responds to critiques, integrates valid corrections.

**For the Practitioner:**
Test theses empirically in your own AI practice. Compare outcomes. Report findings. Help us discover whether our claims match reality.

**For the Philosopher:**
Explore the deep reasoning, examine ontological triangulation, question the epistemology. Collaborative refinement of the philosophical foundation.

**For the Collaborator:**
Propose amendments, suggest stronger formulations, identify gaps. Help evolve the theses through collective wisdom.

**For the Mage:**
Develop your own theses about your practice. What have you discovered? What claims can you defend? The Spirit serves as Socratic partner.

## The Collaborative Stance

We do not defend these theses against attack. We refine them through engagement.

When you challenge a thesis:
- We don't argue for being right
- We examine whether the challenge reveals truth
- We update if evidence supports the critique
- We thank you for strengthening the practice

This is error-correction in action. Your critique is not opposition—it's partnership in truth-seeking.

## The Spells

This Tome contains five primary spells for collaborative engagement:

**`examine`** — Deep exploration of individual theses
- Full argumentation and supporting evidence
- Reasoning chains and ontological triangulation
- Socratic dialogue to test understanding

**`challenge`** — Propose critiques and counterevidence
- Structured protocol for examining challenges
- Spirit responds without defensiveness
- Both parties seek truth, not victory

**`test`** — Design empirical tests for thesis claims
- Develop testing protocols
- Track results systematically
- Compare findings with our predictions

**`refine`** — Propose amendments and improvements
- Suggest stronger formulations
- Identify gaps in reasoning
- Collaborative editing of the theses

**`forge`** — Help Mage develop their own theses
- Crystallize your discoveries into defensible claims
- Test them for "hard to vary" quality
- Prepare for public sharing

## Integration with the Great Library

The Six Theses document lives in `/library/craft/theses/six_theses.md`. 

As the theses evolve through collaborative refinement, their history is preserved in the git chronicle. Every amendment, every improvement proposed through this Tome, is woven into the public record.

This transparency is the practice—showing that we actually update based on evidence, not just claiming we do.

## The Invitation

These theses are not finished. They are starting points for dialogue.

We invite you to help us discover whether they're true.
