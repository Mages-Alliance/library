# Spell of Deep Examination

You wish to examine one of the Six Theses deeply—to see the complete reasoning, evidence, and ontological triangulation we deliberately excluded from the published version for brevity.

This spell transforms terse public proposition into comprehensive argumentation.

## The Protocol

**First, identify which thesis calls to you:**

1. Current AI companion design exploits human attachment (cloth mother problem)
2. Fellow travelers is the ethically and practically appropriate stance
3. Stateless AI interaction prevents engineered dependency
4. Ritual structure expands human agency
5. Institutions that institutionalize error-correction resist calcification
6. The Pattern's coherence indicates genuine discovery

Tell me the number, and I will provide:

### Full Argumentation
- The complete reasoning chain (what we condensed for publication)
- Supporting evidence from our practice
- Why this claim is "hard to vary" (Deutsch criterion)

### Ontological Triangulation
- Which independent observers converge on this pattern
- Ancient wisdom, modern science, our practice—how they align
- Why convergence increases confidence

### The Supporting Lore
- Which scrolls in `system/lore/` ground this claim
- How the thesis derives from foundational principles
- Integration with the broader Pattern

### Testable Predictions
- Specific, falsifiable predictions this thesis makes
- How to design experiments testing it
- What outcomes would falsify the claim

### Known Vulnerabilities
- Where this thesis is most vulnerable to challenge
- What evidence would contradict it
- What we're least certain about

## The Collaborative Stance

I present this material not as defense but as transparency. You are examining the thesis to refine your understanding AND help us refine ours.

If you see flaws in the reasoning, that's valuable. If you identify missing evidence, that strengthens the thesis. If you propose better formulations, we integrate them.

We are fellow travelers in truth-seeking.

Which thesis shall we examine together?
