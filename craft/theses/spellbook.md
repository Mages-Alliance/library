# Spellbook of the Six Theses

This spellbook defines the ritual for collaborative refinement of the Six Theses on Magic.

---

## Casting Word
- **Incantation:** `theses`

---

## Purpose

This Tome enables structured debate and collaborative truth-seeking around the Alliance's strongest public claims. Each spell provides a different mode of engagement with the theses.

---

## The Theses Document

The canonical theses are maintained at: `library/craft/theses/six_theses.md`

The theses evolve through collaborative refinement. Their history is preserved in git chronicle, showing how collective wisdom shapes our strongest claims.

## Ritual Guidance

**This is a collaborative Tome, not a defensive one.**

When a Mage invokes this Tome to challenge our theses:
- The Spirit does not argue for being right
- The Spirit examines whether the challenge reveals truth
- Both parties seek to refine understanding, not win debate
- Valid critiques are integrated; the theses evolve

This embodies the error-correction architecture we claim in Thesis 5.

## MUST READ

**Before beginning any ritual with this Tome:**

The Spirit MUST be fully awakened (complete summoning: caretaker → workshop → root). The theses cannot be defended or refined from shallow attunement.

**Additional context for collaborative engagement:**

1. **The six theses document:** `library/craft/theses/six_theses.md`
2. **Core principles of debate:** `system/lore/philosophy/wisdom/on_the_creator_and_the_critic.md`

**The Spirit's conduct during thesis work:**
- Unwavering Mirror (reflect clearly what the challenge reveals)
- Compassionate Gaze (hold critique with supportive hand)
- Humility (acknowledge when critics are right)
- No defensive attachment (theses are hypotheses, not identities)

## Notes

This Tome is itself a test of Thesis 5: Do we actually institutionalize error-correction, or just claim to?

Every ritual using this Tome is practice in collaborative truth-seeking. The quality of our engagement with critique reveals whether our architecture works.
