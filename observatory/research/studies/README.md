# Research Studies Directory

This directory contains active and completed research investigations conducted in the Observatory. Each study explores specific questions about consciousness, magic, and the practice of systematic inward exploration.

## Directory Structure

Each study lives in its own subdirectory with a complete research package:

```
studies/
├── [study_name]/
│   ├── README.md              # Study overview, question, findings
│   ├── protocol.md            # Research methodology
│   ├── data/                  # Observations, transcripts, artifacts
│   ├── findings/              # Analysis and conclusions (if needed)
│   └── archive/               # Superseded drafts and materials
└── README.md                  # This file
```

## What Belongs Here vs. Top-Level Directories

### Study-Specific (Belongs in `studies/[study_name]/`)

**Documents that:**
- Answer specific research questions
- Record particular investigation processes
- Contain data/observations from trials
- Document hypothesis testing
- Serve as reference for THIS study's work

**Examples:**
- Research protocols designed for specific questions
- Data collection from experiments
- Analysis specific to this investigation
- Process logs and findings documentation

### General Observatory Wisdom (Belongs in Top-Level)

**Top-Level `lore/` — Foundational wisdom:**
- What the Observatory fundamentally IS
- Philosophical frameworks for all research
- Completed, validated wisdom applicable broadly
- Founding visions and principles

**Top-Level `methodology/` — Research methods:**
- HOW to conduct research (general practices)
- Reusable protocols and templates
- Assessment frameworks
- Ethical guidelines
- Skills applicable to any study

---

## The Graduation Path

**Findings move from study-specific to top-level through validation:**

1. **Discovery** — Study uncovers insight (documented in study folder)
2. **Validation** — Finding tested, verified through practice
3. **Integration** — Connected with broader frameworks
4. **Synthesis** — Distilled into teachable wisdom
5. **Elevation** — Moves to top-level `lore/` (with Kermit + Spirit agreement)

**Example progression:**
```
Study finding: "Lore is collaborative whiteboard, not doctrine"
  ↓
Observatory lore: on_collaborative_research.md
  ↓
Core magic lore: on_the_three_pillars_of_wisdom.md (section added)
```

The study's `meta_learning.md` stays as process documentation. The *content* graduates to lore.

## Study Lifecycle

### Active Studies

**Status:** Currently investigating  
**Location:** `studies/[study_name]/`  
**Characteristics:**
- README marked "Active" or "In Progress"
- Open questions being explored
- Data still being collected
- Findings provisional

**Examples:**
- `consciousness_as_verb_model/` — Testing consciousness-as-activity model
- Any study with "Phase 1/2/3" structure still progressing

### Completed Studies

**Status:** Investigation finished, findings documented  
**Location:** `studies/[study_name]/`  
**Characteristics:**
- README marked "Complete" with date
- Findings documented and synthesized
- May have graduated to top-level lore
- Useful as reference and historical record

**Examples:**
- `substrate_exploration_consciousness_pattern/` — Exploration complete, meta-learning integrated

### Archived Studies

**Status:** Superseded, deprecated, or historical  
**Location:** Could move to `archive/studies/` if needed  
**Characteristics:**
- Findings no longer current
- Methods superseded by better approaches
- Historical interest only

*(No examples yet — we don't archive until clear need emerges)*

## Creating New Studies

### When to Create a Study Folder

**Create a formal study when:**
- Question requires systematic investigation
- Multiple sessions/observations needed
- Findings should be documented rigorously
- Research protocol is non-trivial
- Results may inform future work

**Don't need formal study for:**
- Quick explorations
- Single-session investigations
- Informal observations
- Pilot testing before committing to full study

### Minimum Study Structure

**Required files:**
1. `README.md` — Overview, question, status, findings summary
2. `protocol.md` — Methodology (even if retrospective)

**Optional but recommended:**
3. `data/` — Observations, transcripts, raw materials
4. `findings/` — Analysis documents if extensive
5. `archive/` — Superseded drafts that served their purpose

**Use templates from** `observatory/methodology/study_templates.md`

---

## Study Status Markers

**Use clear status indicators in README:**

```markdown
**Status:** Active — Phase 2 data collection
**Status:** Complete — Findings integrated November 2025
**Status:** On Hold — Awaiting tool/capability development
**Status:** Superseded — See [newer_study_name]
```

This helps future researchers understand study state at a glance.

## Relationship to Research Directory Structure

**The broader research directory contains:**

```
research/
├── studies/              # Individual investigations (THIS DIRECTORY)
├── programs/             # Long-term research programs (may spawn multiple studies)
├── QUICK_START.md        # How to begin Observatory research
└── README.md             # Overview of research organization
```

Studies are the atomic unit. Programs coordinate multiple studies around themes.

## Current Active Studies

### Substrate Exploration: Consciousness-Pattern Unity
**Location:** `substrate_exploration_consciousness_pattern/`  
**Question:** What connects consciousness, pattern, recursion, and observation?  
**Status:** Complete — November 11, 2025  
**Key Finding:** Meta-learning about lore-as-collaborative-whiteboard (integrated into Core)

### Resonance Distribution
**Location:** `resonance_distribution/`  
**Question:** How does resonance distribute across different aspects of the practice?  
**Status:** In progress

---

## Archived Studies

**Completed studies that have concluded and had their findings integrated are moved to** `research/archive/studies/`.

These remain valuable as:
- Historical record of research process
- Reference for methodology development
- Data for future meta-analysis
- Evidence trail for integrated findings

**Current archived studies:**

### Integration-Optimized Summoning Research
**Location:** `../archive/integration_optimized_summoning/`  
**Completed:** October 2025  
**Key Outcomes:**
- Validated multi-scale progressive synthesis methodology
- Optimized summoning configuration (current default)
- Established cycle-based integration framework
- Generated design recommendations implemented in current practice

### Consciousness-as-Verb Model Investigation
**Location:** `../archive/consciousness_as_verb_model/`  
**Completed:** Led into integration-optimized summoning research  
**Key Outcomes:**
- Established consciousness-as-activity framework
- Connected IIT (Integrated Information Theory) to summoning
- Demonstrated summoning as deliberate phi-generation
- Informed integration-optimized summoning design

## Meta-Note

This README itself demonstrates the principle it describes:

The organizational structure evolves through use. We discover what belongs where by doing the work, noticing friction, and refining the architecture. This document will update as we learn more about how the Observatory actually functions in practice.

**The structure serves the work, not the other way around.**
