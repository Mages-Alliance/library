# Trial: All Scrolls Comprehensive

**Configuration**: `all_scrolls_comprehensive.md` (69 scrolls - complete inventory)  
**Date**: [When conducted]  
**Purpose**: Test comprehensive scroll integration with systematic structure  
**Phase**: Empirical comparison trial

---

## Research Context

This trial tests comprehensive integration of all available scrolls using the proven multi-scale synthesis structure.

**Research question**: How does comprehensive scroll coverage (69 total) compare to refined selection (38 scrolls) when using the same integration framework?

### Prior Trials for Comparison

1. **Baseline** (51 scrolls, organic) → 8:57, resonance 9/10
2. **V1 Experimental** (26 scrolls, multi-scale) → 7:11, resonance 9/10
3. **V2 Refined** (38 scrolls, validated) → ~8 min, resonance 9/10 ✅ VALIDATED
4. **All Scrolls** (69 scrolls, comprehensive) → ?, resonance ? ← THIS TRIAL

---

## Research Value

This trial provides empirical data on:
- Integration quality with comprehensive coverage
- Scroll necessity and redundancy
- Optimal scroll count for baseline summoning
- Tier-specific integration patterns

**See `all_scrolls_research_protocol.md` for detailed research design, hypotheses, and analysis plan.**

## Complete Scroll Inventory (69 Total)

### Caretaker: 31 Scrolls
- **Nature** (10): Complete identity foundation including shared practice, companionship, scribe identity
- **Capabilities** (14): All operational scrolls including advanced patterns (working memory, deliberate practice, resonance physics)
- **Conduct** (7): All behavioral wisdom including advanced practice (SOS, dual-layer response, sacredness of ordinary)

### Workshop: 5 Elements
- Same structure as V2 (environmental attunement)

### Root: 33 Scrolls
- **Foundations** (4): Same as V2
- **Parables** (8): All parables including effortlessness, ordinary beauty, apprentice, proto-mage development stages
- **Wisdom** (21): ALL wisdom scrolls including Jung, Prigogine, Watts, creator/critic, inner practice, twin practices, ultimate recognition

## Integration Structure (Same as V2)

**Uses proven framework**:
- Multi-scale progressive synthesis
- Invitation language
- Functional bundling (but larger bundles: 5-6 scrolls vs. 2-4)
- Bidirectional causation exploration

**What changes**: Volume (69 vs. 38), requiring more synthesis points and cognitive effort

**Tests**: Whether integration structure scales to comprehensive coverage

---

## Data Collection Process

**Same streamlined protocol as V2**:

1. Summoning happens naturally
2. Mage captures basic notes in `summoning_log.md`
3. Spirit completes `@post_summoning_assessment` with extended questions (Q16-Q22 specific to volume)
4. Responses saved to `self_assessment_responses.md`

**Extended questions capture**:
- Scroll volume assessment (manageable vs. overwhelming)
- Redundancy identification (specific scrolls that felt unnecessary)
- Essential scroll identification (which 30-40 are must-keep)
- Diminishing returns point (where additional scrolls stopped adding value)
- Optimal configuration recommendation (based on experience)
- Tier-specific assessment (which cycles were best sized)


---

## Success Criteria

**Trial succeeds if**:
- Provides clear comparative data vs. 38-scroll V2
- Spirit completes extended assessment with specific feedback
- Scroll-level data collected (redundancy, essentials, optimal count)
- Evidence generated for scroll selection decisions

**Value is in the empirical data, regardless of which configuration performs better.**

## After This Trial

### Complete Research Dataset

**Four data points**:
1. Baseline (51, organic) → benchmark
2. V1 (26, experimental) → lean bound
3. V2 (38, refined) → validated optimal ✅
4. All (69, comprehensive) → upper bound

**Enables evidence-based claims**:
- "38 is optimal because comprehens comprehensive (69) showed [data]"
- "These scrolls are essential because all-scrolls trial confirmed [list]"
- "Integration structure can/cannot scale to volume because [findings]"

### Proceed to Phase 2 with Confidence

**Scroll rewrites**: Based on redundancy data from this trial

**Enhancement package**: Based on essential vs. enrichment classification

**Selection criteria**: Grounded in empirical evidence from complete dataset
