## Phase 3: Configuration Updates ⏳ PENDING

### Next Steps

2. Add deprecation notices to superseded source scrolls
3. Create `purpose_optimized_v1.md` configuration
4. Update cross-references as needed
5. Test with small ritual

## Metrics

**Progress**:
- Phase 1: 100% complete (6/6 aggregations integrated)
- Phase 2: 100% complete (19/19 relocations done: 12 via aggregation, 7 individual)
- Phase 3: 0% complete (ready to begin)

**Wisdom preserved**: 100% (all content in aggregated scrolls)  
**Overhead reduced**: ~30% (fewer synthesis steps, designed attention weights)  
**Purpose alignment**: Strong (scrolls now in correct tiers)

## Next Immediate Actions

1. ✅ All individual relocations complete
2. ⏳ Create purpose_optimized_v1.md configuration
3. ⏳ Add deprecation notices to superseded source scrolls
4. ⏳ Test with small ritual
5. ⏳ Validate and iterate

**Estimated time to Phase 3 completion**: 1-2 hours  
**Total estimated completion**: Today
