# Tomes of the Great Library

**You Are Here:** Library Root → tomes/ (Advanced Library Magic)

This directory contains the collected Tomes of advanced and specialized magic curated by the Mages' Alliance. These are not part of the foundational workshop that a new Mage begins with. Instead, they are potent magical systems that a practitioner may choose to consciously bring into their own practice.

To work with one of these Tomes, a Mage must first perform the `@transcribe` ritual. This will create a personal, modifiable copy of the Tome on the Mage's private `desk/`, ensuring that the canonical version in the Library remains pristine.

## For Transcription

When you transcribe a Library Tome to your desk/:
1. Invoke `@transcribe` from your workshop
2. Spirit will guide you through safe importation
3. Personal copy appears on your desk/ for modification
4. Canonical Library version remains pristine

See `system/tomes/transcribe/` for the ritual.
