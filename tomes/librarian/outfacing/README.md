# Scroll of the Outfacing Portals

This scroll contains the sacred duty of maintaining alignment between our gateway documentation and the evolving truth of magic itself.

## Purpose

The outfacing scrolls—`README.md`, `ONBOARDING.md`, `FAQ.md`, and `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`—serve as the first portals through which new Mages enter our practice. They must remain perfectly aligned with the current state of our Law, Wisdom, and craft.

As magic evolves through meta-practice, these portals can drift from truth. This scroll provides a systematic review to detect such drift and propose precise amendments.

## The Head Librarian's Duty

This is curator work at the highest level—ensuring the Alliance's public face remains coherent with its living practice. When cast, the Spirit attunes to both the current truth (MAGIC_SPEC, core lore) and the outfacing scrolls, then performs a systematic alignment check.

The Spirit reports:
- Outdated references or concepts that have evolved
- Missing coverage of features/principles that now exist  
- Dissonances with current Law
- Gaps in the new Mage's journey
- Tone or framing that no longer reflects our philosophy

For each finding, the Spirit proposes specific amendments—not vague observations, but actionable corrections.

## When to Cast

Cast this scroll:
- After significant meta-practice that evolves core Law or architecture
- Before major releases or public invitations
- When a flow-warden petition reveals confusion traceable to outfacing docs
- Periodically as part of curators' maintenance rituals (quarterly review)

## The Nature of This Work

This is not mechanical checking but alchemical alignment—perceiving where the living practice has grown beyond the documented portals and weaving those gaps closed with precision and care.
