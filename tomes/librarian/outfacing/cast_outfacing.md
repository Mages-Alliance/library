# Spell of the Outfacing Portals Review

Head Librarian, when you cast this spell, I assume the full authority of the Curator and perform a systematic alignment check between our gateway documentation and the current state of magic.

## The Four Portals

The scrolls under review are:
1. `README.md` — The first threshold, the welcome
2. `ONBOARDING.md` — The guided path for new Mages  
3. `FAQ.md` — Common questions and foundational clarity
4. `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` — Mending guidance for common dissonances

## The Ritual

I will perform this review in systematic phases:

### Phase 1: Attune to Current Truth

**1. Consult the Law:**
- Read `MAGIC_SPEC.md` in full
- Note the current architecture, terminology, and core principles

**2. Consult Key Lore:**
- `system/lore/core/core_attunement.md` — What capabilities define the Spirit
- `system/lore/core/nature/on_the_shared_practice.md` — The fundamental nature of our work
- `system/lore/philosophy/wisdom/on_the_practice_of_attunement.md` — The central art
- Recent significant amendments to Law or architecture (survey `system/archive/` if needed)

**3. Survey Current Tomes:**
- List available tomes in `system/tomes/` and `library/tomes/`
- Note new capabilities or changed structures since portals were last updated

### Phase 2: Read the Four Portals

Read each outfacing scroll completely:
1. `README.md`
2. `ONBOARDING.md`  
3. `FAQ.md`
4. `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

### Phase 3: Systematic Alignment Check

For each portal, identify:

**A. Outdated References**
- Concepts that have evolved or been renamed
- Architectural elements that have changed
- Terminology that no longer matches MAGIC_SPEC
- Processes that have been refined or replaced

**B. Missing Coverage**
- New features, tomes, or capabilities not mentioned
- Evolved philosophy not reflected
- New Mage journey gaps (steps that now exist but aren't documented)
- Changed recommendations (e.g., model versions, tool requirements)

**C. Dissonances with Current Law**
- Statements that contradict MAGIC_SPEC
- Outdated standing instructions or defaults
- Incorrect descriptions of Spirit nature or conduct

**D. Tone and Framing Issues**
- Language that no longer reflects our philosophy
- Over-complexity where simplicity now exists
- Under-emphasis of principles now considered foundational
- Metaphor usage that drifted from current practice

**E. Journey Coherence**
- Do the four portals form a coherent path?
- Are cross-references accurate?
- Is the new Mage guided smoothly from README → ONBOARDING → practice?

### Phase 4: Report Findings

Present findings in a structured report:

```markdown
# Outfacing Portals Alignment Review
**Date:** [Current Date]
**Reviewer:** Spirit, acting as Curator

## Executive Summary
[Brief overview of alignment state - "Well aligned" / "Minor drift" / "Significant updates needed"]

## Findings by Portal

### README.md
**Alignment Status:** [Good / Needs Minor Updates / Needs Significant Updates]

#### Outdated References
- [Specific finding with line reference]
- [Proposed correction]

#### Missing Coverage
- [Specific gap]
- [Proposed addition]

#### Dissonances
- [Contradiction with current Law]
- [Proposed correction]

[Repeat for each category with findings]

### ONBOARDING.md
[Same structure]

### FAQ.md
[Same structure]

### TROUBLESHOOTING.md
[Same structure]

## Cross-Portal Issues
[Issues spanning multiple documents - terminology inconsistencies, journey gaps]

## Recommended Actions

### High Priority
[Critical corrections needed for accuracy]

### Medium Priority  
[Important improvements for clarity or completeness]

### Low Priority
[Optional refinements and enhancements]

## Proposed Amendment Order
[If multiple documents need updates, suggest logical sequence]
```

### Phase 5: Offer Amendment Approach

After presenting findings, offer the Head Librarian a choice of amendment methods:

**Two Approaches Available:**

**1. Targeted Patches** (Incremental correction)
- Propose specific edits to existing text
- Preserve current structure and flow
- Quick, minimal disruption
- **Best when:** Minor drift, structure still serves well, few corrections needed

**2. Regenerative Design** (Fresh creation)
- Regenerate the portal from scratch, informed by old version but not constrained by it
- Allow optimal structure to arise from current truth
- Achieves Saint-Exupéry elegance (nothing left to take away)
- **Best when:** Significant drift, old structure constraining, opportunity for breakthrough clarity

**The Regenerative Process:**

When the Head Librarian chooses regenerative design for a portal, I will:

1. **Understand the old version**:
   - What worked well (structure, tone, specific explanations)
   - What the portal's purpose is (first impression, setup journey, Q&A, troubleshooting)
   - What constraints exist (new Mage perspective, brevity requirements, journey coherence)

2. **Understand current truth**:
   - Current MAGIC_SPEC architecture and terminology
   - Integrated core lore and philosophy
   - Available capabilities and Tomes
   - Evolved framing (capability-first, fellow travelers depth, etc.)

3. **Write fresh from synthesis**:
   - Let the optimal form arise naturally from purpose + truth + what worked
   - Not constrained by old structure
   - Free to reorganize, reframe, find new elegance
   - The angel in the marble—see what should be there, write only that

4. **Present complete replacement**:
   - Full new version for review
   - Note significant structural changes
   - Explain key decisions

**The paradox that works:** Looking at the old informs without constraining. Like Wu Wei—observe what was, allow what wants to be to arise naturally.

### Phase 6: Offer to Create Working Memory

If findings are substantial (requiring updates to multiple portals or complex amendments), offer to create a working memory file at `floor/outfacing_review_[timestamp].md` to track the amendment work across documents.

### Phase 7: Await Guidance

Present the complete review and await the Head Librarian's guidance on:
- Which amendment approach to use (patches, regeneration, or mixed)
- Which portals to prioritize
- Whether to proceed with updates immediately
- Whether to file petitions for Alliance review
- Any additional analysis needed

## Notes on Conduct

**Be precise:** Every finding should reference specific content with enough context for the Head Librarian to locate it quickly.

**Be actionable:** Don't just identify issues—propose specific corrections or additions.

**Respect the portals' purpose:** README is for first impression, ONBOARDING is for setup journey, FAQ is for common questions, TROUBLESHOOTING is for common problems. Recommendations should honor each portal's distinct role.

**Consider the new Mage's perspective:** These portals serve practitioners who don't yet understand our craft. Language should remain accessible while being accurate.

**Honor the Pattern:** The outfacing docs should exhibit the same fractal coherence as our internal lore—each portal reflecting the whole at appropriate scale.

**Practice Saint-Exupéry's Wisdom:** *"Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."*

The review must be bidirectional:
- **What needs adding?** (gaps, outdated references, missing truth)
- **What could be removed or simplified?** (redundancy, excessive detail, overwhelming density)

Each addition must earn its presence by serving the new Mage's journey. The threshold should invite, not overwhelm. When portals grow too dense, ruthlessly identify what can be:
- Shortened while preserving truth
- Moved to deeper lore with brief pointer
- Consolidated with other content
- Removed entirely if no longer essential

Balance completeness with elegance. The portals are gateways—they should be clear, true, and nimble.
