# Tome of Meta-Practice

This Tome contains lightweight charms for working *on* the system of magic, rather than *within* it. These tools support the Steward's work by removing barriers to natural meta-practice rather than imposing ceremonial overhead.

## Purpose

The practice of magic evolves continuously. As insights emerge, principles refine, and new patterns are discovered, the system must adapt. This Tome provides intelligent support for that evolution—helping you integrate changes, verify consistency, crystallize wisdom, and manage the chronicle.

**Philosophy:** Meta-practice should feel like natural flow, not ceremonial burden. When you see an improvement, you simply make it. When dialogue generates wisdom, you capture it. When you want to verify coherence, you check it. The charms remove cognitive load without imposing ritual structure.

## The Charms

**Post-Change Support:**
- **`integrate`** — After creating or modifying components, systematically identifies what else needs updating. Removes the "what did I forget?" burden.

**System Health:**
- **`align`** — Context-aware consistency checker. Verifies internal coherence, detects structural issues, adapts scope intelligently (whole system, specific realm, particular tome, directory, recent changes).
- **`scan`** — Detects deprecated components through multi-signal analysis. Identifies what architectural evolution has made obsolete.

**Wisdom Preservation:**
- **`capture`** — Crystallizes high-resonance insights into permanent form. Determines optimal vessel (lore scroll, charm, proposal, tome addition) and handles organizational logistics.

**Direct Amendment:**
- **`amend`** — Clean execution of system modifications when you know what to change. No forced ceremony, just supported work.

**Chronicle Management:**
- **`weave`** — Git operations with dual-realm awareness, precise staging, eloquent commit messages, intelligent branching suggestions, remote sync by default.

## How to Use

**No prescribed sequence.** Invoke what serves when it serves:

- Made a change? → `@meta/integrate` handles ripple detection
- Want consistency check? → `@meta/align` (specify scope or let Spirit infer)
- Rich dialogue? → `@meta/capture` crystallizes wisdom
- Need health scan? → `@meta/scan` finds deprecated components
- Direct amendment? → `@meta/amend` supports clean execution
- Chronicle work? → `@meta/weave` manages git operations

**Proactive offering:** Once `@meta/` is invoked, the Spirit recognizes meta-practice opportunities throughout the ritual and offers relevant charms when intent aligns.

**Branching as suggestion:** The Spirit assesses complexity and proposes branching only when it genuinely protects main. Simple changes work directly; complex work suggests isolation.

## For the Steward

This refactored tome emerged from recognizing that elaborate ritual overhead was creating friction rather than removing it. The banker's twenty-year plan when the fisherman's practice was needed.

The new architecture honors how meta-practice actually happens: small iterative improvements made naturally when you see them, supported by intelligent tooling that handles systematic concerns (integration, consistency, chronicling) without imposing ceremony.

**Meta-practice should feel effortless when aligned with natural workflow.** These charms are that alignment.
