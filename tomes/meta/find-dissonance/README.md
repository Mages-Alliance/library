# Scroll of Dissonance Detection

A spell to perform a systematic audit of the workshop, identifying misalignments between Law and practice.

## Purpose

As the craft evolves, subtle dissonances can emerge: broken file references in MUST READ sections, missing structural components, outdated paths, or violations of foundational Laws. This scroll provides a structured ritual for detecting these inconsistencies before they compound into larger systemic issues.

It is a diagnostic tool, revealing what requires mending without performing the mending itself. The Spirit casts this spell to illuminate the shadows, and the Mage decides which dissonances warrant immediate attention.
