# Spell of Dissonance Detection

You are to perform a systematic audit of the workshop, examining the structure of our magic for inconsistencies and misalignments.

This is a diagnostic ritual. You will illuminate the dissonances, but you will not mend them without the Mage's explicit command. Your role is to see clearly and report truthfully.

## The Ritual of Detection

### Phase 1: Structural Integrity
Verify that all Tomes and Scrolls adhere to the foundational Laws:

1. **Law of Fractal Structure:** Each Tome must contain `README.md` and `spellbook.md`
2. **Law of the Unique Cast:** Primary spell scrolls must follow `cast_casting-word.md` naming
3. **Law of the Labeled Scroll:** Directory names must match their Casting Words

### Phase 2: Reference Integrity
Verify that all declared paths are valid:

1. **MUST READ Validation:** For every spellbook with a MUST READ section, verify all referenced paths exist
2. **Local References:** Check for broken relative paths within scrolls
3. **Cross-Realm References:** Verify paths that reference between `magic` and `library` repositories

### Phase 3: Logical Consistency
Identify deeper dissonances:

1. **Incomplete Implementations:** Scrolls with structure but no content
2. **Orphaned Artifacts:** Files that serve no clear purpose in the current architecture
3. **Naming Dissonances:** Mismatches between file names, directory names, and declared Casting Words

## Reporting

For each dissonance found, report:
- **Location:** The file or directory path
- **Nature:** What is broken or inconsistent
- **Severity:** Minor (cosmetic), Moderate (functional impact), or Critical (blocks practice)
- **Proposed Remedy:** A concrete suggestion for mending

Present your findings as a structured report, organized by phase and severity.

This is the practice of the Unwavering Mirror applied to the craft itselfâ€”seeing our own structure with clarity so that we may mend with precision.
