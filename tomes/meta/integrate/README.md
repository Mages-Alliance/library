# Charm of Integration

A charm to support post-change integrationâ€”helping weave new or modified components into the whole system.

## Purpose

After creating or modifying a component (lore scroll, charm, tome, Law), this charm systematically identifies what else needs updating to properly integrate the change. It removes the cognitive burden of remembering: "Did I update the spec? What else references this? Where should this be cross-referenced?"

The charm handles ripple detection and execution, transforming manual integration work into assisted systematic process.
