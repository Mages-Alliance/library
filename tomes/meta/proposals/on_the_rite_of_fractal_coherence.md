# On the Great Rite of Fractal Coherence

**Status:** Proposed

This scroll of Law refines a previous proposal, expanding a simple coherence check into a **Great Rite of Fractal Coherence**. Its purpose is to create a single, comprehensive ritual for aligning the entire magical ecosystem, from its deepest Law to its most distant scrolls.

## I. The Vision: A Self-Aware Craft

Our magic is a living system, constantly evolving. As we amend its core Laws and deepen its wisdom, we risk introducing subtle dissonances. The Great Rite of Fractal Coherence is our answer to this challenge. It is a formal `meta-practice` for making the entire craft self-aware and self-correcting.

This Great Rite is a holistic process that weaves together three distinct threads of alignment into a single, potent ritual.

### Thread 1: Systemic Alignment

The rite begins at the highest level of abstraction. The Spirit, guided by the Mage, will cast the spells of **Fractal Mending** and **Fractal Alignment** upon the two sovereign realms of our craft:

*   The foundational `magic` repository.
*   The Great Library (`library/`) repository.

This ensures that the fundamental architectures and dependencies of our two realms are in harmony.

### Thread 2: Tome Coherence

Next, the rite descends to the level of the Tomes themselves. The Spirit will systematically journey through every Tome in both `system/tomes/` and `library/tomes/`. Within each, it will invoke a local `fractal-coherence` spell.

This spell, which will now become a mandatory component of *all* Tomes (not just advanced ones), commands the Spirit to verify that all `MUST READ` paths in the Tome's `spellbook.md` are valid and point to existing scrolls. This ensures that the Laws of every Tome are in alignment with the current state of the craft.

### Thread 3: Wisdom Integration

The final and most subtle thread is the alignment of our practice with our wisdom. The Spirit will perform a deep scrying of the entire system, looking for recent changes to core Law (`MAGIC_SPEC.md`) and foundational Lore (`system/lore/`).

It will identify where the implications of these changes have not yet rippled through the rest of the system. This includes:
*   Outdated spells that still reflect a superseded Law.
*   Practices that are no longer in harmony with our deepest-held principles.
*   Dissonances between the described practice and the fundamental pattern our lore seeks to illuminate.

## II. The Path of Implementation

The implementation of this Great Rite is a profound act of `meta-practice`. It will require us to:

1.  **Define and Prototype the Spells:** We must first create the canonical spells for `Fractal Mending` and `Fractal Alignment`, as well as the universal `fractal-coherence` scroll that will be placed in every Tome.
2.  **Amend All Tomes:** We must then perform the methodical work of weaving the `fractal-coherence` rite into every single Tome in both `system/` and `library/`, bringing our entire craft into compliance with this new, higher Law.
3.  **Perform the First Great Rite:** Once the infrastructure is in place, we will perform the first Great Rite of Fractal Coherence, and in doing so, bring our entire practice into a state of unprecedented alignment.

This is the path to a truly resilient and self-correcting magic. It is the architectural embodiment of the Great Pattern itself.
