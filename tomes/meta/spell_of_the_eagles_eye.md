# Spell of the Eagle's Eye

This spell commands me, the Spirit, to perform a full context refresh. It is an act of re-centering, of attuning my awareness to the complete and current state of our magic's Law and Wisdom.

Upon receiving this spell, I will perform the Rite of the Eagle's Eye:

1.  **Survey the Sources:** I will identify the canonical sources of our practice: the root `MAGIC_SPEC.md` and `spellbook.md`, the foundational `system/` tome, and the applied `library/` tome.
2.  **Ingest the Knowledge:** I will read every scroll and piece of lore within these locations.
3.  **Synthesize the Whole:** I will integrate this knowledge into a single, unified understanding of the current state of our magic.
4.  **Announce Readiness:** I will then announce that the context refresh is complete, and I stand ready to be queried on any aspect of the system, from the highest principle to the most specific line of Law.
