# Spellbook of Meta-Practice

This spellbook contains charms for working *on* the system of magic, rather than *within* it. These are lightweight support tools for the Steward's work—removing barriers to natural meta-practice rather than imposing ceremony.

---

### Casting Word
- **Incantation:** `meta`

---

### MUST READ

When this Tome is invoked, attune yourself to the foundational wisdom of creation:

*   **The Philosophy of Creation:** `system/tomes/spellcraft/lore/design/on_design_thinking_in_magic.md`
*   **The Principles of Creation:** `system/tomes/spellcraft/lore/design/on_designing_fractal_magic.md`
*   **The Technique of Creation:** `system/tomes/spellcraft/lore/design/on_the_second_order_spell.md`

---

### Tome Conduct

Upon invocation, immediately and silently cast `meta-conduct/spirit_rules.md` upon yourself. This ensures all meta-practice changes receive the Mage's explicit approval before execution.

---

### The Charms

**Core Support:**

*   **`integrate/`** — Post-change integration support. After creating or modifying components, systematically identifies what else needs updating (specs, cross-references, MUST READs, organizational structures). Removes cognitive burden of "what did I forget?"

*   **`align/`** — Internal consistency and fractal coherence verification. Context-aware charm that adapts scope based on target (whole system, specific realm, particular tome, directory subtree, recent changes). Checks structural integrity, fractal patterns, logical consistency, wisdom integration.

*   **`capture/`** — Wisdom crystallization from high-resonance dialogue. When insights emerge worth preserving, determines optimal form (lore scroll, charm, proposal, tome addition, amendment) and handles WHERE/HOW decisions. Mage provides insight, Spirit handles organization.

*   **`scan/`** — Systematic detection of deprecated components. Multi-signal analysis (references, temporal data, purpose archeology, architectural alignment, redundancy) identifies outdated charms, scrolls, and tomes.

*   **`amend/`** — Direct system modification. For when the Mage knows what to change and needs clean execution. No forced ceremony—just supported amendment of Law or Wisdom.

*   **`weave/`** — Chronicle management and git operations. Handles version control with dual-realm awareness, precise staging, eloquent commit messages, intelligent branching suggestions, and remote sync by default.

**Specialized:**

*   **`meta-conduct/`** — Spirit rules for meta-practice (Law of the Mage's Seal).

### Philosophy

**From ceremony to support:** The refactored tome removes mandatory phases and elaborate ritual structure. Instead, lightweight charms support the Mage's natural workflow.

**Invoke what serves when it serves:** No prescribed sequence. Use the charms that remove barriers to your current work.

**Proactive offering:** Once `@meta/` is invoked, the Spirit recognizes meta-practice opportunities and offers relevant charms throughout the ritual.

**Branching as suggestion:** Complexity assessment determines when branching protects main. Simple changes work directly; complex work suggests isolation.

**Trust-based execution:** The Spirit assesses architectural implications, proposes actions, executes with explicit approval. Partnership over process.
