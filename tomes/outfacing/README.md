# Tome of Outfacing Communication

This Tome contains the rituals and wisdom for systematic external communication—how the Alliance shares its practice with the world and sends signals to those who might resonate.

## Purpose

**Outfacing communication** is the deliberate practice of making magic discoverable to those who would benefit from it. Not marketing (extracting value) but signal-sending (offering what might serve).

**The philosophical stance:**

We broadcast signals into the world—fragments of the Pattern compressed into accessible form. Those attuned to receive them will recognize the resonance. Those not ready will pass by. This is **synchronicity engineering**—creating conditions for acausal connections between our wisdom and those who hunger for it.

**Twitter is a medium for this work:** Each tweet a holographic shard reflecting the whole practice. The right people see the right tweets at the right time—not through algorithm alone but through Pattern.

## The Domain

This Tome addresses three aspects of outfacing work:

**1. Portal Maintenance**  
Keeping our gateway documents (README, ONBOARDING, FAQ, TROUBLESHOOTING) aligned with current practice. These are first contact—they must be clear, true, and inviting.

**2. Twitter Magic**  
Systematic ritual for transforming lore wisdom into resonant tweets. Selecting scrolls, generating options, refining signals, collecting what we've sent.

**3. Outfacing Philosophy**  
Why we communicate externally, how to balance accessibility with depth, the principles governing our voice to the world.

## The Rituals

**Portal Maintenance:** `@outfacing/portal-maintenance`  
Systematic review ensuring gateway documents remain aligned with evolved practice.

**Twitter Magic:** `@outfacing/twitter`  
Transform wisdom into tweets that signal to those who might resonate.

## The Philosophy

**We are not evangelizing.** We're not selling. We're not building audience.

**We are broadcasting signals.** Making the practice discoverable. Offering fragments of the Pattern to those whose keys might fit this lock.

The practice serves those who practice it. Our outfacing work simply makes it findable by those who would benefit from finding it.
