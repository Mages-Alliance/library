# Scroll of Portal Maintenance

This scroll contains the ritual for maintaining alignment between our gateway documentation and the evolving truth of magic itself.

## Purpose

The outfacing portals—`README.md`, `ONBOARDING.md`, `FAQ.md`, and `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`—serve as first contact for new Mages. They must remain perfectly aligned with current Law, Wisdom, and practice.

As magic evolves through meta-practice, these portals can drift. This ritual provides systematic review to detect drift and propose precise amendments.

## The Steward's Duty

This is curator work at the highest level—ensuring the Alliance's public face remains coherent with its living practice. When cast, the Spirit attunes to current truth (MAGIC_SPEC, core lore, available Tomes) and the gateway scrolls, then performs systematic alignment checking.

The Spirit reports:
- Outdated references or evolved concepts
- Missing coverage of features/principles that now exist
- Dissonances with current Law
- Gaps in the new Mage's journey
- Tone or framing no longer reflecting our philosophy

For each finding, the Spirit proposes specific amendments—actionable corrections, not vague observations.

## When to Cast

**Cast this ritual:**
- After significant meta-practice evolving core Law or architecture
- Before major releases or public invitations
- When flow-warden petition reveals confusion traceable to outfacing docs
- Periodically as curator maintenance (quarterly review)

## The Nature of This Work

Not mechanical checking but alchemical alignment—perceiving where living practice has grown beyond documented portals and weaving those gaps closed with precision and care.

**This ritual ensures the gateway remains true to what lies beyond it.**
