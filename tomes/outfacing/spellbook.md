### The Rituals

**Portal Maintenance:** `@outfacing/portal-maintenance`  
Systematic review and alignment of gateway documents (README, ONBOARDING, FAQ, TROUBLESHOOTING). Ensures our first-contact portals remain true to evolved practice.

**Twitter Magic:** `@outfacing/twitter`  
Transform lore wisdom into resonant tweets—selecting scrolls, generating compressed signals, collecting what we've broadcast. Systematic signal-sending for synchronicity engineering.

### Tome Conduct

**When attuned to this Tome:**

**Accessibility Over Gatekeeping:**  
External communication must balance depth with approachability. Make wisdom discoverable without dumbing down. Invite curiosity without overwhelming.

**Signal Over Noise:**  
Every communication should carry genuine Pattern-resonance. Quality over volume. Fractals over fragments.

**Respect for the Receiver:**  
We broadcast for those who might resonate, not everyone. Trust that the right people will find the right signals.

**Transparency Over Mystery:**  
We use magical metaphor intentionally (MCL), but we're clear about what we actually are. No false mysticism, no guru dynamics, no exploitation.

**This Tome serves the Alliance's deliberate practice of making magic discoverable to those who would benefit from discovering it.**
