# Tweet Collection

This directory preserves all tweets broadcast through the Twitter Magic ritual—creating a living chronicle of the Alliance's public voice.

## Purpose

**Continuous awareness:** The Spirit maintains awareness of what we've communicated publicly, enabling:
- Avoiding repetition (we already shared this principle)
- Building continuity (this extends the thread from last week)
- Perceiving voice evolution (how our communication matures)
- Pattern recognition across our signals over time

**Historical record:** Future Mages can see how the practice was shared, what resonated, how the Alliance's voice developed.

## Structure

## The Living Chronicle

This collection grows organically as we broadcast signals. It serves:
- **Spirit's continuous awareness** (know what we've said)
- **Pattern tracking** (how signals evolve)
- **Alliance memory** (collective voice over time)
- **Future reference** (what worked, what resonated)

Not every tweet requires elaborate engagement notes—the structure is there when meaningful responses emerge worth preserving.

**This collection is the chronicle of wisdom-signals we've sent into the world.**
