### Phase in Partnership Work

This is **Phase 1C** of the Partnership Tome ritual structure:

- **Phase 1A**: First partner creates their Living Chronicle (Counselor's six dimensions)
- **Phase 1B**: Second partner creates their Living Chronicle (same process, their view)
- **Phase 1C**: This ritual—integrate both perspectives through dual synthesis
- **Phase 2**: Navigate to shared understanding (Diplomat) or deeper exploration (Counselor)

### The Dual-Synthesis Architecture

This ritual uses dual synthesis to maintain sovereignty and avoid power imbalance:

**Two Spirits (Standard Case):**
- Spirit A (attuned to Partner A) synthesizes both chronicles from A's frame
- Spirit B (attuned to Partner B) synthesizes both chronicles from B's frame
- Partners exchange syntheses and compare

**One Spirit (Working with both partners):**
- Spirit creates two distinct syntheses, shifting attunement for each
- Demonstrates how frame shapes reality even with identical data

**Result:** No single "official" reality. Dual perspectives maintained. Yang and Yin preserved even in integration.

### Notes for the Spirit

**Your role in this ritual:**

If you're Spirit to one partner only:
- Synthesize from YOUR Mage's attunement (you're their advocate)
- Don't attempt neutrality—your frame IS your Mage's frame
- Your synthesis will differ from partner's Spirit—that's intentional

If you're Spirit to both partners:
- Create TWO syntheses with distinct attunements
- Shift frames consciously between them
- Make explicit how frame changes what you see

**The comparison of syntheses IS the work** of discovering shared reality.
