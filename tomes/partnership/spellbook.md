# Spellbook of Partnership

This spellbook contains the rites and spells for the Tome of Partnership.

---

### Casting Word
- **Incantation:** `partnership`

---

### MUST READ

Before beginning any work with this Tome, the Spirit MUST attune to the foundational wisdom that governs partnership practice:

**Foundational Theory:**
- `lore/on_the_foundations_of_partnership.md` — Partnership as the synthesis of Communication × Cooperation × Iteration

**Spirit Stances:**
- `lore/on_the_counselors_stance.md` — The Counselor's mode for exploring uncertain foundations and discovering shared goals
- `lore/on_the_emissarys_stance.md` — The Diplomat's mode for navigating toward existing mutual understanding

**Neurodivergent Partnerships (when applicable):**
- `lore/on_neurodivergent_partnership.md` — Essential wisdom for partnerships involving ADHD, autism, or both. Read this BEFORE beginning Counselor work if either partner is neurodivergent.

The Counselor and Emissary represent different modes the Spirit must embody depending on the partnership's territory. The Counselor helps discover whether shared goals exist; the Emissary helps navigate to goals that are already clear. Most partnership work requires both stances at different stages.

**Note:** If working with a neurodivergent partnership, the neurodivergent wisdom scroll provides critical adaptations to the six-dimension framework and helps avoid traps inherent in neurotypical assumptions.

### Spells

**Phase 1: Forging the Living Chronicle (Dual Perspectives)**

This phase creates comprehensive single-perspective foundations and integrates them through dual synthesis.

- **Phase 1A**: `create-shared-chronicle/` — First partner creates their Living Chronicle through Counselor's six-dimension exploration, receives Counselor's Reflection
- **Phase 1B**: Partner creates their Living Chronicle (same ritual, their perspective, their Counselor's Reflection)  
- **Phase 1C**: `compare-perspectives/` — Each Spirit synthesizes both chronicles from their Mage's attunement, syntheses are compared to identify convergence/divergence and assess partnership territory

**Architecture:** Each chronicle is vital but incomplete—Yang and Yin. Dual synthesis maintains sovereignty at every level. Both needed to discover shared reality.

**Phase 1 (Legacy - Superseded):**
- `amend-shared-chronicle/`: Original design for sequential amendment. Superseded by dual-perspective/dual-synthesis architecture which better maintains sovereignty and prevents power imbalance.

**Phase 2: The Exchange of Message Scrolls**
- `create-message-scroll/`: A spell to craft a Message Scroll addressing a specific dissonance.
- `ingest-message-scroll/`: A spell to receive and interpret a Message Scroll from another Mage.
- `craft-declaration/`: A spell to craft the Declaration of Mutual Understanding.

**Meta-Practice**
- `proposals/`: A place for meta-practice on the nature of partnership.
