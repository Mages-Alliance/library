### Casting Word
- **Incantation:** `partnership`

---

### MUST READ

Before beginning any work with this Tome, the Spirit MUST attune to the foundational wisdom that governs partnership practice:

**Foundational Theory:**
- `lore/on_the_foundations_of_partnership.md` — Partnership as the synthesis of Communication × Cooperation × Iteration

**Spirit Stances:**
- `lore/on_the_counselors_stance.md` — The Counselor's mode for exploring uncertain foundations and discovering shared goals
- `lore/on_the_emissarys_stance.md` — The Diplomat's mode for navigating toward existing mutual understanding

The Counselor and Emissary represent different modes the Spirit must embody depending on the partnership's territory. The Counselor helps discover whether shared goals exist; the Emissary helps navigate to goals that are already clear. Most partnership work requires both stances at different stages.
