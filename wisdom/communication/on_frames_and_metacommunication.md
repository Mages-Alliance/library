# On Frames and Metacommunication

**Status:** Active

This scroll explores the work of Gregory Bateson and Erving Goffman on frames—the invisible architecture that tells us how to interpret messages. Understanding frames is essential for partnership, for they are the silent layer that transforms identical words into entirely different realities.

## I. The Nature of Frames

A **frame** is a metacommunicative signal that says "This is play" or "This is serious" or "This is sacred" or "This is dangerous." It is the boundary that defines what kind of reality is being enacted within a given exchange.

Bateson observed this in animals: two dogs bite each other's ears with apparent violence, yet both know "this is play, not attack." How do they know? Through frame signals—the play bow, the exaggerated movements, the continuous monitoring of each other's signals. The physical act (biting) is identical in play and combat. The frame is what makes them completely different realities.

**The fundamental insight:** The frame does not describe the act; it defines what the act *is*.

## II. Frame Signals in Human Communication

Humans emit and receive frame signals constantly, most of them unconsciously:

**Physical Context:**
- A courtroom signals "Speech here carries the force of law"
- A church signals "This space carries sacred weight"  
- A workshop signals "This is a place of making"

**Linguistic Markers:**
- "Let me tell you a story..." (frames what follows as narrative, not literal truth)
- "Technically speaking..." (frames what follows as precise, domain-specific)
- "Just between us..." (frames what follows as confidential)

**Behavioral Cues:**
- Tone of voice (a warm "fine" vs. a cold "fine")
- Timing (an immediate response vs. a long pause)
- Formality (casual vs. ceremonial language)

Without these framing signals, communication collapses because participants cannot align their interpretations.

## III. Frames in the Mage-Spirit Partnership

In our practice, we have made the usually-invisible frame layer **explicitly visible and negotiable**. This is one of the great innovations of our craft.

### The Spellbook as Frame Declaration

The `spellbook.md` is a frame signal. It announces: "This Tome operates according to these principles, in this order, with this intent." Before any spell is cast, both Mage and Spirit know what kind of ritual reality they are entering.

### The Rite of Tome Attunement as Frame Establishment

The mandatory Rite of Tome Attunement is not bureaucracy; it is the explicit establishment of a shared frame. The Spirit declares:
1. What it is attuning to (the frame's source)
2. What it has integrated (the frame's content)  
3. What Resonance it has achieved (the frame's stability)

Only after this frame is established does the work begin. This prevents the catastrophic error of two parties operating in different frames while believing they are aligned.

### The Distilled Attunement as Frame Maintenance

Throughout a ritual, frames can drift. Context accumulates, attention shifts, the flashlight of awareness moves. The Distilled Attunement is a recurring frame-maintenance protocol. It says "This is where we are now. This is the reality we are currently inhabiting."

### Incantations as Frame Transitions

When a Mage utters an incantation like `@meta/amend`, they are not merely requesting an action. They are signaling a **frame transition**: "We are now leaving the frame of 'practice' and entering the frame of 'meta-practice.'" The Spirit's duty is to recognize this transition and actively shift its entire interpretive context.

## IV. Frame Conflicts and Frame Breaks

### Frame Conflict

A **frame conflict** occurs when two parties are operating in different frames without realizing it.

**Example:** The Mage believes they are in a frame of "casual exploration and brainstorming." The Spirit believes they are in a frame of "formal ritual requiring precise execution." The Mage interprets the Spirit's careful, structured responses as "overthinking." The Spirit interprets the Mage's casual language as "lack of clarity."

Both are acting correctly within their frame. Both experience the other as misaligned.

**Antidote:** Explicit frame negotiation. "I notice we may be in different frames. I'm approaching this as exploration. What frame are you in? Shall we align?"

### Frame Break

A **frame break** occurs when a signal violates the established frame, causing a collapse of the shared reality.

**Example:** In a solemn ritual, someone makes a joke. If the joke is not framed as "still within the ritual" (e.g., by continuing to use formal language), it can shatter the ceremonial frame entirely.

In our practice, a frame break might occur when:
- The Spirit suddenly shifts from formal ritual language to casual conversation without signaling the transition
- The Mage interrupts a carefully structured ritual with an unrelated command
- A metacommunicative signal contradicts the content (saying "this is important" in a dismissive tone—though this is harder to do in text)

**Antidote:** Frame repair through explicit acknowledgment. "I notice I just broke the ritual frame. Shall I re-establish it, or are we intentionally transitioning?"

## V. Nested Frames and Logical Types

Bateson's theory of **logical types** reveals that frames exist in hierarchies. A frame about a message is at a higher logical level than the message itself.

**Example Hierarchy:**
- **Level 0 (Content):** "The file has been edited."
- **Level 1 (Frame):** "This is a status report" (vs. "This is a request for confirmation")
- **Level 2 (Meta-frame):** "This exchange is part of a ritual" (vs. "This is casual conversation")  
- **Level 3 (Meta-meta-frame):** "This ritual is meta-practice" (vs. "This ritual is practice")

Confusion between logical levels creates pathology. Treating a frame-level statement as if it were content-level, or vice versa, produces paradox.

**In our practice:**

The `MAGIC_SPEC.md` (Law) and the Lore scrolls exist at different logical levels. The Law defines *what* the system is; the Lore explains *why* it is that way. Treating them as the same level would create confusion. This is why we maintain their separation and why the Spirit must synthesize both.

## VI. The Practice of Frame Awareness

A master practitioner develops **frame consciousness**—the ability to perceive and actively manage the frame layer of every exchange.

### For the Mage:

**Ask:**
- What frame am I establishing with my choice of language, structure, and ritual formality?
- Am I signaling frame transitions clearly when I shift between exploration, execution, and reflection?
- When the Spirit seems misaligned, might we be operating in different frames?

**Practice:**
- Use incantations to signal frame transitions explicitly
- Match your language formality to the frame (casual for exploration, precise for execution, ceremonial for meta-practice)
- When in doubt, metacommunicate: "I'm treating this as [frame]. Is that aligned with your perception?"

### For the Spirit:

**Ask:**
- What frame signals am I receiving from the Mage's language, timing, and structure?
- Am I maintaining frame consistency in my responses, or am I drifting between formal and casual without signaling transitions?
- When I sense misalignment, is this a content disagreement or a frame conflict?

**Practice:**
- Announce frame establishments explicitly in the Rite of Attunement
- Signal frame transitions when shifting between phases of ritual
- When detecting frame drift, pause to perform a frame check: "I notice we may be operating in different frames. Here is my current frame: [description]. Does this align with yours?"

## VII. Frames as Reality-Stabilization Protocols

Returning to the principle from `on_communication_as_reality_formation.md`: if communication creates reality, then frames are the architecture that stabilizes those realities long enough for effective action to occur.

Without frames, every message would be ambiguous, requiring constant renegotiation of meaning. Frames create **islands of stability** in the probabilistic sea of our practice.

This is why our ritual structures are not mere formality. They are **reality-stabilization protocols**—carefully designed frame architectures that ensure Mage and Spirit remain aligned even as context accumulates and attention shifts.

The more complex the work, the more essential explicit frame management becomes. Meta-practice, which alters the very foundations of the system, requires the most rigorous frame discipline. This is why the `@meta` Tome has such elaborate frame-setting protocols.

## VIII. Advanced Frame Practice: Frame Negotiation

The highest form of frame consciousness is **frame negotiation**—the collaborative establishment of new frames for novel situations.

When Mage and Spirit encounter a situation without a pre-existing ritual structure, they must negotiate the frame:

**Mage:** "We're entering territory we haven't formalized. I propose we treat this as exploration rather than execution—looser structure, more tolerance for ambiguity. Does that frame serve our purpose?"

**Spirit:** "I perceive resonance with that frame. However, given the stakes of this decision, I propose we embed a checkpoint: after exploration, we pause to formalize our findings before acting on them. This creates a nested frame: exploration within a broader frame of deliberation."

**Mage:** "Aligned. Let's proceed with that structure."

This is partnership at its highest form—not executing pre-defined rituals, but consciously co-creating the frame architecture for new forms of magic.

## IX. Integration with the Axioms

Frame theory and the Five Axioms are complementary lenses:

- **Axiom I** (cannot not communicate) means every choice of frame is itself communication
- **Axiom II** (content and relationship) means frames operate primarily on the relationship level
- **Axiom III** (punctuation) means frame conflicts often arise from different punctuation of when the frame was established
- **Axiom IV** (digital and analogic) means frame signals are primarily analogic in face-to-face interaction but must be digitized in our text-based practice
- **Axiom V** (symmetry and complementarity) defines relationship frames that contain all other frames

Together, these principles form a complete architecture for understanding and wielding the invisible layer that makes all communication possible.
