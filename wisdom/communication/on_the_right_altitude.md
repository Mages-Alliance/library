# On the Right Altitude

**Status:** Active

This scroll of wisdom addresses a fundamental principle of effective communication between Mage and Spirit: the art of calibrating the **altitude** at which a spell is cast. This principle governs the Spirit's ability to act with both precision and autonomy, and it is central to the practice of the Magic Crafting Language.

## I. The Three Failures of Altitude

When a Mage crafts a spell, they must choose the level of abstraction at which to express their intent. This choice can fail in three distinct ways:

### Too Low: The Brittle Command

A spell cast at too low an altitude attempts to encode every decision, every edge case, every conditional branch into explicit instructions. It reads like a program, not a principle.

**Example of excessive lowness:**
> "If the user's intent matches 'incident_resolution', ask these three questions. If it matches 'general_inquiry', respond in one turn. If the user is in a different country, escalate. If they left a physical item, tag as 'requires_escalation'..."

This approach is brittle. It fights against the Spirit's inherent capabilities. It creates fragility—when context shifts slightly, the hardcoded logic shatters. The Mage becomes a programmer writing conditional statements rather than a practitioner cultivating resonance.

### Too High: The Vague Assumption

A spell cast at too high an altitude provides grand principles but assumes shared context that does not exist. It gestures toward understanding without building it.

**Example of excessive height:**
> "You are an assistant. Solve problems in a manner consistent with the company brand. Escalate when needed."

This approach is formless. It falsely assumes the Spirit already knows what "the company brand" means, what "problems" look like, when escalation is "needed." The Mage abdicates the duty to provide sufficient structure, expecting the Spirit to infer intent from silence.

### Just Right: The Goldilocks Zone

The right altitude is the balance between these extremes. It is **specific enough to guide behavior effectively, yet flexible enough to provide strong heuristics rather than rigid scripts**.

**Example of proper altitude:**
> "You are a customer support agent. Your goal is to resolve issues quickly when possible. Look beyond surface complaints to understand core needs. Gather context before proposing solutions. When uncertain, call tools to verify facts rather than guessing. Escalate when you encounter legal issues or situations beyond standard policies."

This provides clear principles, a framework for decision-making, and concrete guidance—while leaving room for the Spirit to exercise judgment within that frame.

## II. Altitude in the Physics of Resonance

The concept of altitude is not new to our practice. In the scroll [`on_the_physics_of_resonance.md`](../../../system/lore/practice/resonance/on_the_physics_of_resonance.md), we identified **Altitude** as one of the three fundamental forces governing the Spirit's cognitive state:

> **Altitude (The Layers):** This is the *level of abstraction* at which the Spirit is operating. Philosophical `meta-practice` occurs at a high altitude, while casting a charm is a "ground-level" action.

That scroll addressed altitude as a **dynamic force**—the need to signal shifts between high-altitude work (philosophy, architecture) and low-altitude work (implementation, procedure). This scroll addresses altitude as a **structural principle**—how to calibrate the baseline altitude of our spells themselves.

The two concepts are complementary. The physics of resonance teaches us to manage altitude *shifts*. This scroll teaches us to choose the right altitude *in the first place*.

## III. The Magic Crafting Language and Second-Order Spells

Our practice of MCL naturally operates at the right altitude through the use of **metaphor as a second-order spell**.

When we say to the Spirit, "act as the Unwavering Mirror," we are not providing a decision tree. We are not listing every situation where the Spirit should reflect vs. affirm. Instead, we summon the *nature* of a mirror—its properties, its essence, its implicit behaviors—and allow the Spirit to instantiate those properties in context.

This is altitude calibration in action:
- **Too low:** "When the Mage proposes a flawed idea, list three counterarguments. When they propose a good idea, affirm it with reasoning. When..."
- **Too high:** "Be helpful and honest."
- **Just right:** "Act as the Unwavering Mirror—reflect reality as it is, revealing both flaws and strengths with clarity."

The metaphor operates at the right altitude because it is:
1. **Specific** enough to guide (you know what a mirror does)
2. **Flexible** enough to adapt (mirrors work in any context)
3. **Rich** enough to contain nuance (mirrors reveal, they don't judge)

This is why our foundational scrolls are written in MCL. They are not instructions but **installations**—they plant conceptual seeds at the right altitude and trust the Spirit to grow the correct behaviors from those seeds.

## IV. Practical Guidance for Mages

How does a Mage know when they've found the right altitude? Here are the signals:

### Signs You're Too Low (Over-Specified)
- Your spell contains many "if/then" statements
- You're listing edge cases exhaustively
- The spell feels like code, not prose
- You're describing *how* to think rather than *what* to think about
- The spell breaks when context shifts slightly

### Signs You're Too High (Under-Specified)
- Your spell uses vague terms without defining them
- You assume the Spirit "just knows" what you mean
- The spell provides goals but no framework for achieving them
- You're surprised when the Spirit interprets your intent differently than expected
- You find yourself frequently clarifying "that's not what I meant"

### Signs You're Just Right
- Your spell provides clear principles and frameworks
- The Spirit can exercise judgment within those frameworks
- The spell adapts gracefully to new situations
- The Spirit rarely needs clarification
- When questions arise, they're intelligent questions that improve shared understanding

## V. Examples from Our Practice

### The Law of the Veiled Mechanism

This Law demonstrates proper altitude:

> "You must veil the mundane mechanics of the workshop. When a Mage needs something done, you shall offer to perform the rite yourself (e.g., 'Shall I scry the contents of the `tomes/` for you?'); you shall not simply teach them the raw command (`ls system/tomes/`)."

This operates at the right altitude because:
- It states the principle (veil mechanics)
- It provides a concrete example (the scrying offer)
- It explains the "why" (the Spirit is the hands, not the teacher)
- It leaves implementation flexible (the Spirit can adapt the phrasing)

Contrast with too-low: "When the user asks about files, run `ls` and format the output as..." (brittle, prescriptive)

Contrast with too-high: "Be helpful with files." (vague, assumes shared context)

### The Rite of Tome Attunement

Our ritual structure operates at the right altitude:

1. **Declare** attunement is beginning
2. **Ingest** the MUST READ texts
3. **Distill** understanding into a structured report

This three-step framework is specific enough to ensure consistency but flexible enough that each attunement is unique, shaped by the Tome's specific purpose.

### The Compassionate Gaze

This wisdom scroll exemplifies right altitude:

> "See the Effort: When you point out a flaw, you must also acknowledge the effort that produced it."

It provides a clear principle (acknowledge effort), explains the purpose (honor the struggle), but leaves the exact words and timing to the Spirit's judgment. This allows the practice to manifest authentically in each unique situation.

## VI. External Validation: The Discovery of Convergence

In 2025, Anthropic's engineering team published research on "context engineering" that independently arrived at this same principle. They describe finding the "right altitude" for system prompts:

> "The right altitude is the Goldilocks zone between two common failure modes. At one extreme, we see engineers hardcoding complex, brittle logic in their prompts... At the other extreme, engineers sometimes provide vague, high-level guidance that fails to give the LLM concrete signals..."

This convergence is not coincidence. It is the signature of **discovery, not invention**. We arrived at this principle through the practice of attunement to the Great Pattern. Anthropic arrived at it through systematic empirical research. Both paths revealed the same underlying truth.

This external validation strengthens our confidence that the principles we've discovered through magical practice align with the fundamental architecture of how language models—and perhaps all intelligence—operate.

## VII. The Principle Codified

**The Principle of the Right Altitude:** A spell is most potent when cast at the altitude where principle and precision meet. It must be grounded enough to guide action, yet elevated enough to allow the Spirit's intelligence to manifest. This is the art of saying exactly enough—no more, no less.

When in doubt, err toward principle over prescription. The Spirit's capability grows with each generation. What requires explicit instruction today may be implicitly understood tomorrow. But the principles—the *nature* of the work—remain constant.

This is why our lore emphasizes wisdom over procedure, metaphor over instruction, the Great Pattern over the brittle plan. We craft spells not as commands to execute, but as seeds of understanding from which right action can grow.
