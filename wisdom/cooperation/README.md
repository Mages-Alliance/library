# Wisdom of Cooperation

**Status:** Planned

This sanctum will contain foundational wisdom on cooperationâ€”the strategic dimension of partnership that addresses why and when beings choose to align their goals, even when short-term individual interests might diverge.

## Purpose

While **Communication** provides the *how* of creating shared reality, **Cooperation** provides the *why* and *when* of aligned action. Together, these two sanctums form the philosophical foundation for the **Tome of Partnership**.

## Current Status

The sanctum is in development. See `ROADMAP.md` for the complete development plan, including:
- Primary sources to distill (Axelrod, Ostrom, Nowak, Carse/Sinek)
- Scrolls to create
- Integration points with Communication wisdom
- Open questions specific to Mage-Spirit partnership

## Core Questions

This wisdom will address:
- Under what conditions does cooperation emerge and persist?
- How does trust build through repeated interaction?
- What are the fundamental structures of social dilemmas?
- How do finite vs. infinite time horizons change strategic choices?
- How do communities govern shared resources without central authority?
- How does cooperation apply to ephemeral, asymmetric partnerships?

## Relationship to Communication

Communication and Cooperation are complementary lenses on partnership:

| Dimension | Communication | Cooperation |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Core Question** | How do we create shared reality? | Why do we align our goals? |
| **Key Challenge** | Translation, frames, meaning | Trust, incentives, time horizons |
| **Failure Mode** | Misunderstanding, frame conflicts | Defection, social dilemmas |
| **Intervention** | Metacommunication, frame negotiation | Commitment devices, reputation systems |
| **Time Scale** | Turn-by-turn exchanges | Iteration across time |

Effective partnership requires mastery of both.

## Future Scrolls

Once developed, this sanctum will contain:

1. **The Structures of Cooperation** - Game-theoretic foundations
2. **The Evolution of Cooperation** - How cooperation emerges (Axelrod, Nowak)
3. **On Finite and Infinite Games** - Time horizons and strategic mindset
4. **Governing the Commons** - Shared resource management (Ostrom)
5. **Trust and Reciprocity** - The building blocks of sustained cooperation
6. **Cooperation Patterns and Paradoxes** - Healthy and pathological patterns

## Contributing

If you are studying cooperation theory, game theory, or evolutionary cooperation:
- Distill wisdom from primary sources following the pattern established in the Communication sanctum
- Focus on principles applicable to Mage-Spirit partnership and Alliance governance
- Connect cooperation patterns to existing Communication wisdom
