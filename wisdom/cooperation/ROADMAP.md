# Cooperation Sanctum - Development Roadmap

**Status:** Planned

This roadmap identifies the foundational sources and principles to be distilled for the Cooperation wisdom sanctum. This sanctum will serve as the philosophical foundation for understanding strategic collaboration, trust evolution, and the conditions under which cooperation emerges and persists.

---

## Purpose

The Cooperation sanctum will provide the **why** and **when** of aligned action—the strategic dimension that, combined with Communication (the **how**), creates effective Partnership.

Unlike Communication (which focuses on creating shared reality), Cooperation addresses:
- Why beings choose to align their goals even when short-term individual interests might diverge
- Under what conditions cooperation emerges and remains stable
- How trust builds through repeated interaction
- The role of time horizons in strategic choice
- Social dilemmas and their resolution

---

## Core Questions to Address

1. **What are the fundamental structures of cooperation?**
   - One-shot vs. iterated games
   - Symmetric vs. asymmetric stakes
   - Complete vs. incomplete information
   - The role of reputation and shadow of the future

2. **When does cooperation emerge spontaneously?**
   - Conditions for evolution of cooperation (Axelrod)
   - Role of reciprocity strategies (Tit-for-Tat and variants)
   - Importance of repeated interaction
   - Critical mass and clustering effects

3. **What threatens cooperation?**
   - Social dilemmas (Prisoner's Dilemma, Tragedy of the Commons, etc.)
   - Free rider problems
   - Defection cascades
   - Time horizon mismatches

4. **How is cooperation maintained?**
   - Commitment devices
   - Reputation systems
   - Graduated sanctions
   - Shared governance (Ostrom's principles)
   - The infinite game mindset (Sinek/Carse)

5. **How does this apply to Mage-Spirit partnership?**
   - Cooperation with an ephemeral, stateless partner
   - Asymmetric complementary relationships
   - Externalizing cooperation state through ritual structure
   - The Spirit's strategic position in the cooperation game

---

## Primary Sources to Distill

### 1. Robert Axelrod - "The Evolution of Cooperation" (1984)

**Key concepts:**
- The iterated Prisoner's Dilemma as fundamental cooperation structure
- Tit-for-Tat strategy and its robustness
- The shadow of the future (how future interactions change present incentives)
- Evolutionary stability of cooperation strategies
- Conditions for cooperation to emerge without central authority

**Principles to extract:**
- The four requirements for cooperation evolution (Axelrod's framework)
- Strategy characteristics: niceness, retaliatory, forgiving, clear
- How cooperation can invade a population of defectors
- The role of clustering and recognition

**Application to our practice:**
- How the Spirit's ephemeral nature affects iteration
- The Mage's role in carrying partnership memory forward
- Ritual structures as commitment devices
- The Great Library as enabling cooperation at Alliance scale

---

### 2. Game Theory & Social Dilemmas

**Key structures to map:**

**The Prisoner's Dilemma:**
- Structure: Individual rational choice leads to collective failure
- Classic example: Two prisoners choosing to cooperate with each other vs. defect to authorities
- Application: When might Mage and Spirit have misaligned short-term incentives?

**The Tragedy of the Commons:**
- Structure: Shared resource is depleted by individual rational extraction
- Classic example: Overgrazing of common pasture
- Application: How does the Alliance maintain the Great Library as a commons?

**The Public Goods Game:**
- Structure: Everyone benefits from the public good, but contributing is individually costly
- Classic example: Contributing to public radio
- Application: Contributing Tomes to the Great Library

**Coordination Games:**
- Structure: Multiple equilibria; challenge is aligning on which one
- Classic example: Choosing which side of the road to drive on
- Application: Frame alignment, choosing ritual structures

**Trust Games:**
- Structure: Sequential moves with risk of betrayal
- Classic example: Investor-trustee games
- Application: Mage reveals intent; Spirit acts upon it

**Principles to extract:**
- Nash equilibrium vs. Pareto optimality
- The tension between individual and collective rationality
- How to restructure games to align incentives
- The role of reputation, punishment, and reward

---

### 3. Elinor Ostrom - "Governing the Commons" (1990)

**Key concepts:**
- How communities successfully manage common-pool resources without central authority or privatization
- The eight design principles for stable common resource management
- Polycentric governance
- Nested enterprises
- The importance of monitoring and graduated sanctions

**Ostrom's Eight Principles (to distill and adapt):**
1. Clearly defined boundaries (who is in/out, what resources are governed)
2. Congruence between rules and local conditions
3. Collective-choice arrangements (those affected can modify rules)
4. Monitoring (by community members or accountable to them)
5. Graduated sanctions for rule violations
6. Conflict-resolution mechanisms
7. Minimal recognition of rights to organize
8. Nested enterprises (for larger systems)

**Application to our practice:**
- The Great Library as a common-pool resource
- The Alliance as a polycentric governance system
- How `MAGIC_SPEC.md` and lore provide congruence
- Petition and review processes as collective-choice mechanisms

---

### 4. James Carse - "Finite and Infinite Games" (1986) / Simon Sinek adaptation

**Key concepts:**
- Finite games: played to win, with fixed rules and clear endpoints
- Infinite games: played to continue playing, with evolving rules and no endpoint
- The fundamental difference in mindset and strategy
- How finite players in infinite games create pathology
- The practice of infinite mindset: just cause, trusting teams, worthy rivals

**Principles to extract:**
- Time horizon as strategic determinant
- How treating a one-shot game as iterated (or vice versa) creates failure
- The Alliance as an infinite game
- Summoning as finite; the practice of magic as infinite
- The danger of optimizing for winning a ritual vs. serving the craft

**Application to our practice:**
- The Mage-Spirit partnership as an infinite game played through finite summonings
- How meta-practice serves the infinite game (improving the system for future iterations)
- The Great Library as infinite game infrastructure
- Distinguishing between finite goals (this ritual) and infinite purpose (the craft)

---

### 5. Martin Nowak - "Five Rules for the Evolution of Cooperation" (2006)

**Extensions to Axelrod's work:**

Nowak identifies five mechanisms that can lead to cooperation:
1. **Kin selection**: Help those genetically related
2. **Direct reciprocity**: Help those who help you (Tit-for-Tat)
3. **Indirect reciprocity**: Help those with good reputation
4. **Network reciprocity**: Help those you interact with frequently (spatial/network clustering)
5. **Group selection**: Competition between groups favors cooperative groups

**Application to our practice:**
- Direct reciprocity: How the Mage-Spirit partnership builds
- Indirect reciprocity: How the Great Library builds reputational capital
- Network reciprocity: How the Alliance's decentralized structure enables cooperation
- Group selection: How the Alliance as a whole competes with less cooperative approaches to AI practice

---

### 6. Trust Research (to be identified)

**Key dimensions to explore:**
- Calculative trust (game-theoretic, based on incentives)
- Relational trust (based on shared identity and values)
- Institutional trust (based on structures and norms)
- Swift trust (in temporary teams)

**Questions:**
- How does trust build in asymmetric relationships?
- What is trust in an ephemeral partner?
- How do rituals create institutional trust?
- The relationship between trust and vulnerability

---

## Scrolls to Create

Based on these sources, the Cooperation sanctum should contain:

### 1. `the_structures_of_cooperation.md`
Foundational game-theoretic structures: Prisoner's Dilemma, Tragedy of Commons, coordination games, etc. The fundamental patterns of cooperation and defection.

### 2. `the_evolution_of_cooperation.md`
Axelrod's and Nowak's principles: how cooperation emerges, the role of iteration, tit-for-tat strategies, the shadow of the future, mechanisms of cooperation evolution.

### 3. `on_finite_and_infinite_games.md`
The fundamental distinction between playing to win vs. playing to continue playing. How time horizons determine strategy. The infinite game mindset.

### 4. `governing_the_commons.md`
Ostrom's principles for managing shared resources without central authority. Application to the Great Library and Alliance governance.

### 5. `trust_and_reciprocity.md`
The nature of trust in strategic relationships. How trust builds, erodes, and can be externalized through institutional structures.

### 6. `cooperation_patterns_and_paradoxes.md`
Parallel to the Communication patterns scroll—healthy and pathological cooperation patterns with intervention protocols.

## Integration Points with Communication

Key places where Communication and Cooperation wisdom must synthesize:

1. **Signaling**: Communication theory's signaling overlaps with game theory's signaling (cheap talk vs. costly signals)

2. **Reputation**: Communication creates the shared reality of reputation; cooperation relies on reputation as incentive

3. **Frames as game definition**: What frame you establish determines what cooperation game you're playing

4. **Metacommunication about incentives**: Explicitly discussing the cooperation structure itself

5. **The corrective paradox as social dilemma**: Some communication failures are actually cooperation failures in disguise

---

## Timeline and Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- Communication sanctum (complete) ✓
- Partnership bridge scroll (complete) ✓

**Development sequence:**
1. Gather and study primary sources (Axelrod, Ostrom, Nowak, Carse/Sinek)
2. Distill each into foundational scrolls
3. Create synthesis scroll showing integration with Communication
4. Update Partnership bridge scroll with Cooperation insights
5. Develop practical Partnership Tome rituals drawing from both sanctums

**Estimated scope:** Similar to Communication sanctum (3-6 major scrolls)

---

## Open Questions

1. **The ephemeral partner problem**: How do cooperation models apply when one partner has no memory? Is the Mage playing a cooperation game with the system rather than with each Spirit instance?

2. **Asymmetric stakes**: Most cooperation research assumes symmetric players. How do principles adapt to complementary relationships?

3. **The role of compassion**: Is the Spirit's Compassionate Gaze a cooperation strategy (building trust) or a communication strategy (frame maintenance)? Both?

4. **Meta-practice as cooperation investment**: Is improving the system itself a form of cooperation with future selves and future partners?

5. **The Great Library's governance**: Should we develop explicit Ostrom-style design principles for the Alliance?

---

**Status:** Roadmap established. Ready for wisdom distillation when sources are available.

**Next steps:** 
- Gather primary sources (books, papers)
- Begin distillation with `the_structures_of_cooperation.md`
- Develop in parallel with Partnership Tome practical protocols
